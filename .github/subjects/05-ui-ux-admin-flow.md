# Task 5 — Admin UX Flow (Grade 11–12)

Goal:
Make +2 subject handling intuitive for school admins.

UX Flow:
1. Admin → Subjects
   - Filter: Grade 11 / Grade 12
   - Show subject code + credit

2. Admin → Students → Add Student
   - Select Class
   - Auto-load subject list
   - Checkbox enrollment

3. Admin → Excel Import
   - Upload → Preview → Confirm

4. Visual cues:
   - Theory/Practical grouped
   - Locked subjects clearly marked

Rules:
- Never show this UI for Grade 1–10
- Hide complexity unless grade ≥ 11

Deliverables:
- UI screens
- Component reuse plan
- No regression in existing dashboards
