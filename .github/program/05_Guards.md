Goal: Program-aware student enrollment.

Tasks:
- On Grade 11/12 student form:
  - Show Program dropdown
  - Auto-load Program subjects
- Allow add/remove subjects
- Persist into StudentSubject table

Rules:
- Program only suggests subjects
- StudentSubject is final authority

STOP after enrollment flow works.
